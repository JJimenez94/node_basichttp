All the comments into the code are made from me looking to get some stuff clearer, take it at your own risk.

#### Results

When the execution starts the server shows up something like:
![server](server_running.png)

And when a request arrives:
![request](serving_request.png)

In this case the request was launched from Postman and the response was received good!
